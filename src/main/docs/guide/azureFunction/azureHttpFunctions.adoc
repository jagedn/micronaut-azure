An additional module exists called `micronaut-azure-function-http` that allows you to write regular Micronaut controllers and have them executed using Azure Function. To get started add the `micronaut-azure-function-http` module.

dependency:io.microaut.azure:micronaut-azure-function-http[]

You then need to define a function that subclasses api:azure.function.http.AzureHttpFunction[] and overrides the `invoke` method:

snippet::example.MyHttpFunction[project-base="doc-examples/example", indent="0"]

<1> The function class subclasses api:azure.function.http.AzureHttpFunction[] and includes a zero argument constructor.
<2> The function name can be whatever you prefer
<3> You can choose to handle ony specific HTTP methods
<4> In general you want a catch all route as in the example, but you can customize it.
<5> The auth level specifies who can access the function. Using `ANONYMOUS` allows everyone.
<6> The received request optionally contains the raw bytes
<7> The body of the method should just invoke the `route` method of the super implementation.

NOTE: The example also illustrates that you can bind to Micronaut Azure HTTP functions the Microsoft Azure types https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.executioncontext?view=azure-java-stable[ExecutionContext], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.httprequestmessage?view=azure-java-stable[HttpRequestMessage] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.tracecontext?view=azure-java-stable[TraceContext]. If you are already binding `ExecutionContext`– as in the example – the host tracing context can be obtained from the bean with a method call to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.executioncontext?view=azure-java-stable#com-microsoft-azure-functions-tracecontext-gettracestate()[getTraceContext()].

With this in place you can write regular Micronaut controllers as documented in the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpServer[user guide] for the HTTP server and incoming function requests will be routed to the controllers and executed.

This approach allows you to develop a regular Micronaut application and deploy slices of the application as Serverless functions as desired.
